2. Install dependencies:


```shellscript
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:


```plaintext
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Start the development server:


```shellscript
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- `src/components/Chat.tsx`: Main chat interface component
- `src/hooks/useChat.ts`: Custom hook for chat functionality
- `src/utils/deepseek-client.ts`: DeepSeek API integration
- `src/utils/file-operations.ts`: File system operations
- `src/utils/conversation-manager.ts`: Chat history and context management


### Key Features

1. **Chat Interface**

1. Real-time message streaming
2. Markdown support
3. Code syntax highlighting
4. Error handling and loading states



2. **File Operations**

1. File reading and writing
2. Directory traversal
3. Diff generation for file modifications
4. Safety checks and validations



3. **AI Integration**

1. Context-aware responses
2. Code analysis capabilities
3. Intelligent code modifications
4. Rate limiting and error handling





## Usage

### Basic Chat

Simply type your questions or requests in the chat interface. The AI will respond with relevant code, explanations, or suggestions.

### File Operations

Use the following commands in the chat:

- `/add <path>`: Add a file or directory to the conversation context
- `/ls <path>`: List contents of a directory
- `/cat <path>`: Display contents of a file
- `/exec <command>`: Execute a shell command (use with caution)


### Code Modifications

When requesting code changes, the AI will:

1. Analyze the existing code
2. Generate appropriate modifications
3. Show a diff preview of changes
4. Apply the changes upon confirmation


## Development

### Building for Production

```shellscript
npm run build
npm start
```

### Running Tests

```shellscript
npm run test
```

### Linting

```shellscript
npm run lint
```

2. Direct file editing capabilities
3. Syntax-aware code modifications



2. **Advanced Features**

1. Multi-file context understanding
2. Project-wide refactoring
3. Test generation
4. Documentation generation



3. **User Experience**

1. Custom themes
2. Keyboard shortcuts
